# XiaoMi-Air-7thGen-High-Sierra-EFI
This EFI file can be used with Xiaomi mi notebook air i5(7200U) with high Sierra. I know there's some other efi folders out there but without changing (I used upper version as a reference) I couldn't be able to adjust brightness , use headphone jack, and show battery percentage. Thanks to Roberto Gorge and /daliansky .  For the privacy purposes, I removed S/N, SmUUID,MLB and ROM. Enjoy your Hackintosh! !
